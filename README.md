# WindowRememberer

The goal is to create a simple system tray app that can easily save and restore window positions, since Windows is ridiculously bad at it. An app for this purpose may exist already. If I find one that doesn't suck, I'll probably just stop working on this app.

The name may change. I couldn't think of anything better.
