# WindowRememberer

WindowRememberer is a simple system tray app for Windows that lets you save and restore window sizes and positions. This comes in handy when a e.g. a game changes the resolution and all your windows are suddenly all screwed up.

Tested on Windows 10.

The name may change. I couldn't think of anything better.

## TODO

- Save properties to disk.
- Restoring maximized windows properly.
- Multi-window support?
